•  What does fast-forward in git mean?
 In fast-forward, git simply moves the source branch pointer to the target branch pointer without creating an extra merge commit.
•  Why should you have different branches? 
Branching allows each developer to branch out from the original code base and isolate their work from others.
•  In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have? 
In a project, every developer should work on a different remote Git repository(branch) such that they are not working on master for these new features but are working on these new features on a different remote. After they are done with the new feature, they can merge/send a pull request from the remote to master so that their changes are pushed to the master/production branch. In any case, there should be at least 2 remote Git repositories(branches): one being the master and the other being the development branch. It is a good practice to have a branch for each user story.
